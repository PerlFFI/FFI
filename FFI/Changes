	- Set version to 1.00, to reflect "final" status

1.01  Thu Jun 19 22:04:59 2003
	Installation improvements.
	- FFI now uses the _installed_ ffcall libraries and headers,
	  rather than those in the ./ffcall directory.
	- Linux installation now works.
	- Fixed two warnings in FFI.xs.
	- Replaced the old ./ffcall contents with the current ffcall-1.8.
	- t/basic.t now uses Test, and win32.t was tweaked.  Hopefully the
	  automated module testers will now be happier.
